Cobra is a discontinued general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.[1] Cobra is designed by Charles Esterbrook, and runs on the Microsoft .NET and Mono platforms.[2] It is strongly influenced by Python, C#, Eiffel, Objective-C, and other programming languages.[3] It supports both static and dynamic typing.[4][5] It has support for unit tests and contracts.[4] It has lambda expressions, closures, list comprehensions, and generators.[6]
Cobra is an open-source project; it was released under the MIT License on February 29, 2008.[7][8]
