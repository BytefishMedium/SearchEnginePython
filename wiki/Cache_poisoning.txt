From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Not to be confused with cache pollution.
Cache poisoning refers to a computer security vulnerability where invalid entries can be placed into a cache, which are then assumed to be valid when later used.[1]  Two common varieties are DNS cache poisoning[2] and ARP cache poisoning. Web cache poisoning involves the poisoning of web caches[3] (which has led to security issues in programming languages, including all Python versions at the time in 2021, and expedited security updates[4]). Attacks on other, more specific, caches also exist.[5][6][7]
