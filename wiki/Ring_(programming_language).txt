 Ring at Wikibooks

Ring is a dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language. It can be embedded in C/C++ projects, extended using C/C++ code and/or used as a standalone language.[5] The supported programming paradigms are imperative, procedural, object-oriented, functional, meta, declarative using nested structures, and natural programming.[6][7] The language is portable (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android,[8] WebAssembly,[9] etc.)[10] and can be used to create console, GUI, web, game and mobile applications.[11][12][13][14]


History[edit]
Ring IDE (Ring Notepad - Form Designer)
In 2009, Mahmoud Samir Fayed created a minor domain-specific language called Supernova that focuses on User interface (UI) creation and uses some ideas related to Natural Language Programming, then he realized the need for a new language that is general-purpose and can increase the productivity of natural language creation. Ring aims to offer a language focused on helping the developer with building natural interfaces and declarative DSLs.[15][16][17][18]

Goals[edit]
PWCT 2.0 (Android) - Under development using Ring
The general goals behind Ring:[19]
[20]

Applications programming language.
Productivity and developing high quality solutions that can scale.
Small and flexible language that can be embedded in C/C++ projects.
Simple language that can be used in education and introducing Compiler/VM concepts.
General-Purpose language that can be used for creating domain-specific libraries, frameworks and tools.
Practical language designed for creating the next version of the Programming Without Coding Technology software.[21]
Examples[edit]
Different styles for writing the source code
Declarative Programming (Web Development)
Natural Language Programming
Testing TreeView Control Performance using RingQt
Hello World program[edit]
The same program can be written using different styles. Here is an example of the standard "Hello, World!" program using four different styles.
The first style:

see "Hello, World!"

The second style:

put "Hello, World!"

The third style:

print("Hello, World!")

Another style: similar to xBase languages like Clipper and Visual FoxPro

? "Hello, World!"

Change the keywords and operators[edit]
Ring supports changing the language keywords and operators.
This could be done many times in the same source file, and is useful for

Translating the keywords from English to other human languages (Non-English-based programming languages)
Customizing the language for use of a favorite style
Porting Legacy code written in other languages
Translate Ring keywords to Japanese

ChangeRingKeyword  See 手紙を出す
ChangeRingOperator + そして
改行 = nl
します。 = :します。

手紙を出す "こんにちは、世界" そして 改行 します。

ChangeRingKeyword 手紙を出す See // キーワードの復旧
ChangeRingOperator そして     + // 演算子の復旧

Translate Ring keywords to Arabic

ChangeRingKeyword  See إطبع

إطبع "Hello, World!"

ChangeRingKeyword إطبع See

Use style similar to the Pascal programming language

ChangeRingKeyword func function
ChangeRingKeyword see  write
begin = :begin

function main
begin
write("Hello, World!");
return 0;
end

ChangeRingKeyword function func
ChangeRingKeyword write see

[22][23][24]

Loop command[edit]
The Loop command can take an integer to apply the continue semantics to enclosing outer loops[25]

changeRingKeyword loop continue
count = 2
for x in 1:5
    for y = 1 to 2
        if x = 3
            ? "About to execute 'loop', count = " + count
            continue count
        ok
        ? "x: " + x + ", y: " + y
    next
next

Object-oriented orogramming[edit]
Ring supports object-oriented programming (classes, objects, composition, inheritance, encapsulation, etc.)[26]

new point {            # Create new object from the Point class the access the object using braces
x=10  y=20  z=30       # Set the object attributes
print()                # Call the print() method
}                      # end of object access using braces
class point            # Define the class
x y z                  # Define the attributes (x,y,z)
func print             # Define the print() method
? x + nl + y + nl + z  # Print the attributes values (nl means printing a new line)

In Ring classes can be defined at runtime using the Eval() function[27]

? "Creating a new class dynamically..."
eval("class DynamicClass a b")

? "Printing the instance..."
? new DynamicClass {a=1 b=2}

Implementation[edit]
Compiler and virtual machine[edit]
Ring VM implementation using PWCT - Virtual Machine Instructions
Ring VM implementation using PWCT - List Structure
Ring programs are not interpreted directly from the textual Ring file, but are compiled into bytecode, which is then run on the Ring virtual machine. The compilation process is typically invisible to the user and is performed at run-time, but it can be done offline in order to increase loading performance or reduce the memory footprint of the host environment by leaving out the compiler.
The compiler and the virtual machine are designed using visual programming through the Programming Without Coding Technology software then the C code is generated.

Extensions[edit]
Online Form Designer (WebAssembly) - Using RingQt
Sokoban Implementation using Ring Game Engine for 2D Games
Using Qt3D through RingQt
The following are extensions that can be used immediately after the installation of the full installation version (with a file size of about 280 MB for Ring 1.12). Since these are officially provided and maintained on the Ring side, the users are not bothered by library dependencies that may cause problems in other languages, and there is a concern that they can not be used suddenly even if there are destructive language specification changes.
The extensions are implemented in approximately 500,000 lines of C and C++ code.

RingAllegro (Allegro Game Library)
RingConsoleColor (Text coloring library for command prompt or the terminal)
RingCurl (CURL Library)
RingFreeGLUT (FreeGLUT)
RingInternet (Internet related library)
RingLibUV (LibUV-asynchronous I / O library)
RingMurMurHash (Hash Function Library)
RingMySQL (MySQL)
RingODBC (Open Database Connectivity)
RingOpenGL (OpenGL 1.1-4.6)
RingOpenSSL (OpenSSL)
RingPostgreSQL (PostgreSQL)
RingQt (Qt framework)
RingRayLib (raylib)
RingSDL (SDL-Simple DirectMedia Layer Library)
RingSQLite (SQLite)
RingWinAPI (Windows API)
RingWinCREG (Windows Registry)
RingZIP (zip file processing library)
[28]

Documentation[edit]
Ring is distributed with documentation written using Sphinx. A Japanese translation of the documentation is also available.[33]

Reception[edit]
Popularity[edit]
Ring had a rapid rise and fall in popularity as measured by the TIOBE Programming Community Index. In February 2018, Ring broke into the top 50 for the first time (position 45).[34] As of October 2020, Ring holds position 93 on the TIOBE index.[35] Ring is listed by GitHub in the list of programming languages that are actively developed.[36]

Criticism[edit]
Ring critics pointed to some features in Ring that are not common in widely used programming languages.[37]

The list index starts from 1 instead of 0 (See: Zero-based numbering)
Implicit type conversions  (See: Implicit type conversions and "type punning")
The list index starts from 1 instead of 0[edit]
In Ring, the index of the first item in lists and the first character in strings is 1.

cName = "Ring"
? cName[1]      # print R
aList = ["One","Two","Three"]
? aList[1]      # print One

Implicit type conversions[edit]
The language can automatically convert between numbers and strings.[38]

/*
** Rules:
** <NUMBER> + <STRING> --> <NUMBER>
** <STRING> + <NUMBER> --> <STRING>
*/

x    = 10                # x is a number
y    = "20"              # y is a string
nSum = x + y             # nSum is a number (y will be converted to a number)
cMsg = "Sum = " + nSum   # cMsg is a string (nSum will be converted to a string)
